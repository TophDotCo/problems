# IPSC Problems

This repository contains the changes that were made to the original resources of the IPSC problems (as found in the [IPSC archive](https://ipsc.ksp.sk/archive)) to make them compatible with Toph.

The problems from IPSC are being added to Toph to allow sport programmers to practice solving them by directly submitting their solutions.
